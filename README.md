# Naavak – Eye-Guided Drawing App (Unity + Tobii)

Naavak is an experimental digital art application that lets users draw using their gaze, powered by Tobii eye-tracking and built entirely in Unity with C#.

It was created as part of a collaborative research project to explore non-conventional interaction systems. As the sole developer, I designed and implemented all aspects of the software.
